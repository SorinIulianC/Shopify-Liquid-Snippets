    let's assume the url path is store/pages/selected_collection
    and based on the query parameter we are sending we want to hide a specific product
    the path then becomes store/pages/selected_collection/$hide_product=specific_product_id
    i use $hide_product as the query param (i use $ because it's easier to find in the path string)
  endcomment
  if request.path contains '$hide_product='
    assign collection_url = request.path | split: '$hide_product=' | first
    comment
      this will output store/pages/selected_collection/
    endcomment
    assign collection_url = request.path | split: '/' | last
    comment
      this will output selected_collection which in our case is a collection handle named "selected_collection"
    endcomment
    assign product_slug = request.path | split: '$hide_product=' | last
    comment
      this will output the handle for the product we want to hide which in our case is a handle named "specific_product_id"
    endcomment
    assign collection = collections[collection_url]
    for product in collection.products
      unless product.handle == product_slug

          do stuff
